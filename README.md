# Dyslexia by a dyslexic
Dyslexia by a dyslexic website is designed for two types of visitors. Firstly, make people with dyslexia feel that they are not alone in their experiences. Secondly allow non-dyslexics appreciate some of the differences of dyslexics.

## User Experience (UX)
### Initial design
#### Scope and Strategy
There are lots of websites that provide technical information for dyslexics. These usually require a lot of reading, which is not advantageous for dyslexics and can be quite daunting. This website is going to use minimal text to provide an easy place for people wanting to find out more about dyslexia or feel that they are not alone/comment on their experiences.
It is out of scope of this project to provide any technical or medical advice.
#### Skeleton
* Landing page
* Hints and Tips and what it is like
* Form for people to share their experiences
#### Wireframes
## Features
### Existing Features
Every page will have navigation to the other pages in the header and links to other external resources in the footer.
The landing page provides links to other pages to make it apparent what the site can be used for, explaining the purpose of the site.
The next page is a page for people to see what dyslexia is like and provides solutions to some common experiences. This page has video in the center that gives some idea of how difficult it is to read as a dyslexic.
There is also a box that changes color to give people some idea how blue can be a calming color to read against as opposed to glaring white or yellow.
Form to submit  
### Features Left to Implement
The form currently doesn't actually capture the data that is submitted. This would be a next stage implementation.
Ideally the site would also contain more examples and hints and tips as the knowledge base was increased through user input.
A form that counts up how many of the common things experienced by dyslexics you experience.
## Maintenance
The external links to other resources need to be monitored to ensure that they are still leading to valid pages.
