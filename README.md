# Dyslexia by a dyslexic
<p>Dyslexia by a dyslexic website is designed for two types of visitors. Firstly, make people with dyslexia feel that they are not alone in their experiences. Secondly allow non-dyslexics appreciate some of the differences of dyslexics.</p>

## User Experience (UX)
### Initial design
#### Scope and Strategy
<p>There are lots of websites that provide technical information for dyslexics. These usually require a lot of reading, which is not advantageous for dyslexics and can be quite daunting. This website is going to use minimal text to provide an easy, calm and safe place for people wanting to find out more about dyslexia or feel that they are not alone/comment on their experiences.</p>
<p>It is out of scope of this project to provide any technical or medical advice. </p>

#### User Stories
<p> First time user will use the site either as a potential dyslexic to discover more about if they are dyslexic and what they have in common with dyslexics or as a person interested in what being dyslexic is like. They will also be able to benefit from some ideas of how to work around dyslexic experiences.</p>
<p>Repeat and Frequent users will come back as a place to find other resources about dyslexia and as the hints and tips section expands learn more ways to do things easily.</p>

#### Skeleton
- Landing page, to give user information on purpose of site
  - Header including logo, title and links to internal pages
  - Boxes to explain why this site exists, links to other parts of the site and a link to the checklist to find out if you have dyslexia
  - Footer, links to external resources
- Hints and Tips and what it is like
  - Header including logo, title and links to internal pages
  - Boxes to show different things experienced by dyslexics and tricks to get round them.
  - Video of moving text
  - Footer, links to external resources
- Form for people to share their experiences
  - Header including logo, title and links to internal pages
  - Form with Name and email contact and a text box to include personal experiences
  - Footer, links to external resources
#### Wireframes
## Features
### Existing Features
<p>Every page will have navigation to the other pages in the header and links to other external resources in the footer.</p>
<p>The landing page provides links to other pages to make it apparent what the site can be used for, explaining the purpose of the site. It also has a navigation bar in the top and links to internal pages in the main section to aid movement around the site.</p>
<p>The next page is a page for people to see what dyslexia is like and provides solutions to some common experiences. This page has video in the center that gives some idea of how difficult it is to read as a dyslexic.</p>
<p>There is also a box that changes color to give people some idea how blue can be a calming color to read against as opposed to glaring white or yellow. This part of the site is purposefully not a nice color or easy to read to show that this what dyslexics experience.</p>
<p>Form to submit </p> 

### Features Left to Implement
The form currently doesn't actually capture the data that is submitted or validate that the form has all the sections filled. These would be good next stage implementation.


Ideally the site would also contain more examples and hints and tips as the knowledge base was increased through user input.


An additional page containing a form that counts up how many of the common things experienced by dyslexics you experience. So that people don't go to external sites for this information.

## Maintenance
The external links to other resources need to be monitored to ensure that they are still leading to valid pages.
