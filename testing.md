# Testing for "Dyslexia by a dyslexic"

## General testing

General testing was performed throughout development to ensure that the coding was behaving as anticipated. Bugs were fixed during development see Bugs section of README.md.

Responsiveness was tested using the Chrome extension Responsive Veiwer, the result of which is in README.md in the section responsiveness on different devices.

My family Pat Walmsley and Sarah Walmsley and my partner Ian Harris used the website as typical user level participants. Pat Walmsley used a laptop and the browser xx. Sarah Walmsley used an ipad with Safari and Ian Harris used a google blah with xx.
