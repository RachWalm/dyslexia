# Testing for "Dyslexia by a dyslexic"

## General testing

General testing was performed throughout development to ensure that the coding was behaving as anticipated. Bugs were fixed during development see Bugs section of README.md.

Responsiveness was tested using the Chrome extension Responsive Viewer, the result of which is in README.md in the section responsiveness on different devices.

My family Pat Walmsley and Sarah Walmsley and my partner Ian Harris used the website as typical user level participants. Pat Walmsley used a laptop and the browser Chrome. Sarah Walmsley used an ipad with Safari and Ian Harris used a google app with a Galaxy S10.

Pat Walmsley suggested to alternative wording and text positioning and size changes, but no bugs reported.

Sarah Walmsley and Ian Harris did not report any bugs.

This testing team covered a variety of device compatibilities, browsers and abilities.

## Responsiveness on different devices

Devices sizes checked using developer tools chrome extension for responsive viewer.
